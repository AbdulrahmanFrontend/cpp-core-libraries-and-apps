# C++ Core Libraries & Applications Suite

A **modular C++ solution** that demonstrates strong fundamentals in data structures, object-oriented programming, and real-world problem solving.

This repository contains multiple libraries and console applications built from scratch using C++.

## 📦 Included Projects

### 🔹 Core Libraries
- **DblLinkedListLibrary** – Template-based doubly linked list implementation
- **DynamicArrayLibrary** – Custom dynamic array with manual memory management
- **QueueLibrary / StackLibrary** – Queue and Stack implementations using linked lists
- **QueueArrayLibrary / StackArrayLibrary** – Queue and Stack implementations using arrays

### 🔹 Utility Libraries
